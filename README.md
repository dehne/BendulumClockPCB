This is drop-in replacement for the protoboard used in the initial implementation of my bendulum 
clock. It functions as an Adruino shield implementing the hardware interface between the Arduino Uno
that drives a bendulum clock and the rest of the bendulum clock. Its shape is not that of a 
traditional Arduino shield.

Note that this board was only designed, not built. The BendulumClockShield implements same 
functionality in a traditional Arduino shield and has been tested.
