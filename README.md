This is the more complex of two PCBs that implements the hardware interface between the Arduino Uno
that drives a bendulum clock and the rest of the bendulum clock. It is more complex only in that it
implements a battery backup. If the power fails, the clock keeps going! Also, it does not have the 
traditional outline of an Arduino shield because it is meant to mount inside a bendulum clock
built the way I built mine.

Note that this board is still being tested; it's not ready for release yet.
